# movieDb-fetch

Coding exercise:

Using the Movie db API Documentation available at https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api, write a program that will:
Print the name of the top 10 TV shows
Print the 10 top rated episodes' names for the top 10 TV shows
Print the 10 most popular actors for those 10 TV shows
The program has to parallelize requests and aggregate the results as efficiently as possible.
You can write in Scala (preferred) or Java.
We expect you to produce almost production ready code. The goal is for us to gauge the quality of your code, your ability to extract a meaningful domain, and to program self-documenting code.
